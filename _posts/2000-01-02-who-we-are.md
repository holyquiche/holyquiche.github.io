### *WHO WE ARE*

We are the new quiche on the block!

We are also quite French, and as our DNA
commands, we love food.

We enjoy talking about food, preparing food,
sharing food with friends and family, talking
about the food we just had...and do it all over
again.

And above all, we love making people happy when
they try our food.

### *WHAT OUR FOOD IS ALL ABOUT*

We want to bring simple, honest and flavorful French
comfort food to California, but sparing you the usual
saltiness of the bill.

We offer a variety of quiches, including Vegetarian
and Vegan options, together with fresh signature
salads and colorful chilled soups.

Our menus are designed using local, sustainable and
organic ingredients. They evolve with the seasons.
